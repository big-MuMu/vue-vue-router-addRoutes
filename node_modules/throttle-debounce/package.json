  "readme": "# throttle-debounce\n\n[![Build Status][ci-img]][ci]\n\nThrottle/debounce your functions.\n\nThis module is the same as [jquery-throttle-debounce][jquery-throttle-debounce] ([with some differences](#differences-with-original-module)), but it’s transferred to CommonJS so it can be easily used with tools like Browserify or Webpack.\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\nnpm install throttle-debounce --save\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar throttle = require('throttle-debounce/throttle');\nvar debounce = require('throttle-debounce/debounce');\n\nthrottle(300, function () {\n\t// Throttled function\n});\n\ndebounce(300, function () {\n\t// Debounced function\n});\n```\n\n## API\n\n### throttle(delay, noTrailing, callback, debounceMode)\n\nReturns: `Function`\n\nThrottle execution of a function. Especially useful for rate limiting execution of handlers on events like resize and scroll.\n\n#### delay\n\nType: `Number`\n\nA zero-or-greater delay in milliseconds. For event callbacks, values around 100 or 250 (or even higher) are most useful.\n\n#### noTrailing\n\nType: `Boolean`\n\nOptional, defaults to false. If noTrailing is true, callback will only execute every `delay` milliseconds while the throttled-function is being called. If noTrailing is false or unspecified, callback will be executed one final time after the last throttled-function call. (After the throttled-function has not been called for `delay` milliseconds, the internal counter is reset)\n\n#### callback\n\nType: `Function`\n\nA function to be executed after delay milliseconds. The `this` context and all arguments are passed through, as-is, to `callback` when the throttled-function is executed.\n\n#### debounceMode\n\nType: `Boolean`\n\nIf `debounceMode` is true (at begin), schedule `clear` to execute after `delay` ms. If `debounceMode` is false (at end), schedule `callback` to execute after `delay` ms.\n\n### debounce(delay, atBegin, callback)\n\nReturns: `Function`\n\nDebounce execution of a function. Debouncing, unlike throttling, guarantees that a function is only executed a single time, either at the very beginning of a series of calls, or at the very end.\n\n#### delay\n\nType: `Number`\n\nA zero-or-greater delay in milliseconds. For event callbacks, values around 100 or 250 (or even higher) are most useful.\n\n#### atBegin\n\nType: `Boolean`\n\nOptional, defaults to false. If `atBegin` is false or unspecified, callback will only be executed `delay` milliseconds after the last debounced-function call. If `atBegin` is true, callback will be executed only at the first debounced-function call. (After the throttled-function has not been called for `delay` milliseconds, the internal counter is reset).\n\n#### callback\n\nType: `Function`\n\nA function to be executed after delay milliseconds. The `this` context and all arguments are passed through, as-is, to `callback` when the debounced-function is executed.\n\n## Differences with original module\n\n* Dependancy on jQuery is removed, so if you rely on GUIDs set by jQuery, plan accordingly\n* There is no standalone version available, so don’t rely on `$.throttle` and `$.debounce` to be available\n\n## Browser support\n\nTested in IE8+ and all modern browsers.\n\n## License\n\n**Original module license:** Copyright (c) 2010 \"Cowboy\" Ben Alman (Dual licensed under the MIT and GPL licenses. http://benalman.com/about/license/)  \n**This module license:** MIT © [Ivan Nikolić](http://ivannikolic.com)\n\n[ci]: https://travis-ci.org/niksy/throttle-debounce\n[ci-img]: https://img.shields.io/travis/niksy/throttle-debounce/master.svg\n[jquery-throttle-debounce]: https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-throttle-debounce\n",
